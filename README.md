# my_repository
Repository containing my files for the Advanced Scientific Programming with python course!

For the final project in the course, I want to take some existing, working code that I have from my research and I want to do three things:
I)  Run it through a linter to improve coding style.
II) Add proper documentation to supporting functions.
III) Create some test functions to test for the most common errors
