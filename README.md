# my_repository
Repository containing my files for the Advanced Scientific Programming with python course!

For the final project in the course, I want to take some existing, working code that I have from my research and I want to do three things (in order of decreasing importance):

I) Create some test functions to test for the most common errors.

II) Add proper documentation to supporting functions.

III) If time permits, run the code through a linter to improve coding style.
